MODULAR PLAN
All programs in this assignment use three user-defined modules:
pgmDef.c
pgmInput.c
pgmOutput.c


MODULE NAME: pgmDef.c
FUNCTION: This module defines constants used in all the utility programs
and defines the struct PGMFile, as well as a function to initialize it.

Constants defined in this module: Exit codes for various errors, magic number standard values,
minimum and maximum allowed maxgray and image dimensions, commentLine maximum length, etc.

Functions defined in this module:
• void initializePGMFile(struct PGMFile *pointer)
It takes in a pgmfile struct pointer and initializes its values.


MODULE NAME: pgmInput.c
FUNCTION: This module defines functions related to reading from input pgm file.

Functions defined in this module:
• int getMagicNumber(struct PGMFile *pointer, FILE *inputFile, char* filename)
Function takes in a PGMfile struct, input file stream, string filename as parameters.
Reads magic number of given file into struct and returns relevant code

• int getComment(struct PGMFile *pointer, FILE *inputFile, char* filename)
Function takes in a PGMfile struct, input file stream, string filename as parameters.
Reads comment of given file into struct and returns relevant code

• int getHeader(struct PGMFile *pointer, FILE *inputFile, char* filename)
Function takes in a PGMfile struct, input file stream, string filename as parameters.
Reads header of given file into struct and returns relevant code

• int imageReadASCII(struct PGMFile *pointer, FILE *inputFile, char* filename)
Function takes in a PGMfile struct, input file stream, string filename as parameters.
Reads ASCII data of given file into struct and returns relevant code

• int imageReadBinary(struct PGMFile *pointer, FILE *inputFile, char* filename)
Function takes in a PGMfile struct, input file stream, string filename as parameters.
Reads Binary data of given file into struct and returns relevant code


MODULE NAME: pgmOutput.c

FUNCTION: This module implements functions related to pgm program output,
such as writing image data to a outputfile,
comparing two images for logical equivalence,
reducing an image by a given factor and producing a new smaller image.

Functions defined in this module:
• int imageWriteASCII(struct PGMFile *pointer, FILE *outputFile, char *outputFilename)
Function takes in a ASCII PGMfile struct, output file stream, output file name as parameters
Writes data of given struct into output file and returns relevant code

• int imageWriteBinary(struct PGMFile *pointer, FILE *outputFile, char *outputFilename)
Function takes in a Binary PGMfile struct, output file stream, output file name as parameters
Writes data of given struct into output file and returns relevant code

• int imageCompareASCII(struct PGMFile *pointer1, struct PGMFile *pointer2)
Function takes in two ASCII PGMfile structs as parameters
Compares width, height and pixel data of both structs and returns relevant code

• int imageCompareBinary(struct PGMFile *pointer1, struct PGMFile *pointer2)
Function takes in two Binary PGMfile structs as parameters
Compares width, height and pixel data of both structs and returns relevant code

• int imageReduce(struct PGMFile *pointer1, struct PGMFile *pointer2, int reductionFactor, FILE *inputFile)
Function takes in two PGMfile structs, input file stream, reduction factor as parameters
Reduces data in first struct by reduction factor, stores in second struct, returns relevant code



MAIN ROUTINES USING ABOVE MODULES: pgmEcho.c, pgmComp.c, pgma2b.c, pgmb2a.c, pgmReduce.c, pgmTile.c, and pgmAssemble.c.
Modules are also reused across all programs of this assignment.
